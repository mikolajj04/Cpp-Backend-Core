# Snake Game (C++) in progress...
**🚧 Work in Progress:**UI/Game map-generation in CMD implemented.
*Self-collision detection needed:** Implement logic to detect when the snake's head intersects with its body segments (using `SnakeList::isSnakeAt`).
**Rule of Five (Memory Management) implementation to do:** Implement Copy/Move constructors and Assignment operators for the `SnakeList` class to ensure safe resource management with `std::unique_ptr`.
### 📄 Documentation
Technical documentation will be generated via **Doxygen** upon project completion.
